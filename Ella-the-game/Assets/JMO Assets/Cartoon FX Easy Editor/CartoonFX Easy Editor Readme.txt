====================================

You can display the editor window within the menu:
Window -> CartoonFX Easy Editor
It allows you to easily change one or several Particle Systems properties:
"Scale Size" to change the size of your Particle Systems (changing speed, velocity, gravity, etc. values to get an accurate scaled up version of the system; also, if the ParticleSystem uses a Mesh as Shape, it will automatically create a new scaled Mesh).
It will also scale lights' intensity accordingly if any are found.
Tip: If you don't want to scale a particular module, disable it before scaling the system and re-enable it afterwards!
"Set Duration" to change the duration of your Particle Systems in percentage according to the base effect duration (i.e. if you want longer or quicker effects). 100% = normal duration.
"Loop/Unloop Effect" to set Looping on/off for all the selected Particle Systems at once.
"Set Start Color(s)" to change the start color(s) of your Particle Systems.
"Tint Colors" to change the hue only of the colors of your Particle Systems (including gradients).

The "Copy Modules" section allows you to copy all values/curves/gradients/etc. from one or several Shuriken modules to one or several other Particle Systems.
Just select which modules you want to copy, choose the source Particle System to copy values from, select the GameObjects you want to change, and click on "Copy properties to selected GameObject(s)".

"Include Children" works for both Properties and Copy Modules sections!

Enjoy! :)
